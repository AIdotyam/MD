# Project Background:

The poultry industry is an important sector in Indonesia's agricultural economy, providing a significant source of protein and livelihoods for many people. However, the management of chicken farms, especially on a large scale, presents challenges such as health monitoring. Traditional manual methods are time-consuming, prone to human error, and often fail to address problems promptly, resulting in economic losses and compromised animal welfare.

To address these challenges, our project, AI.yam, aims to develop an AI-based computer vision system that automates key monitoring tasks in chicken farms. By leveraging machine learning models and advanced image processing techniques, the solution provides farmers with real-time insights, enabling better farm management, reducing risk, and increasing productivity.


# Application Details:

The AI.yam app is a mobile app interface that allows users to interact with the system. The main functions of this app include:

- **Mortality Detection**: Identify dead chickens through image analysis, allowing for timely relocation and reducing the risk of disease spread.

- **Notifications**: The system provides direct notifications to the farmer's app if any dead chickens are detected.

- **Automatic Logging**: Scanned data is automatically integrated into the dashboard as a historical reference.

- **Trend Analysis**: Dashboards visualize data, allowing farmers to spot trends and make decisions based on identified patterns.

The app uses Kotlin for development, integrates with the cloud through Retrofit and displays photo uploads from a gallery or camera. The app provides results processed by machine learning models hosted in the cloud and includes a history feature for farmers to review past data and trends.


# Use Cases:

• **Image Scan**: Farmers can use the app to upload or take pictures of the chicken coop directly through the camera.

• **AI Analysis**: The AI system analyzes the uploaded images to detect the presence of dead chickens.

• **Notifications**: Cloud server automatically sends notifications to farmers to take immediate action on chickens that are detected dead.

• **Dashboard**: The results of AI analysis, including dead chicken data, will be saved and displayed on the dashboard. This dashboard provides detailed information about the scanned data to assist farmers in monitoring the health of chickens.
